In the initial stages of this project, I found it quite t**Rick**y to manoeuvre around GitHub and Arduino but once I started, I was on a **Roll**. 
Through many trials and tribulations, I was able to explore the creation of 🔈 sound 🔊 using the Piezo and thus lead me to programming the arduino to play a 🎵 song 🎹. 

_-You can find instructions on how to set up your Arduino Board [here](

People express themselves through their body language, the words they say, the things they create and a host of other mechanisms. If you really think about it, memes have become a way to encapsulate emotions, experiences, thoughts in an open and honest way. Memes can be applied to many scenarios ranging from forgetting to defrost the chicken before your parents return home or the isolating experiences of the coronarius pandemic.
