In the initial stages of this project, I found it quite t**Rick**y to manoeuvre around GitHub and Arduino but once I started, I was on a **Roll**.

Through many trials and tribulations and countless hours spent watching [tutorials](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/infoelectorials/project-016-arduino-christmas-piezo-buzzer-project-ff7414) online, I was able to explore the creation of üîà sound üîä using the Piezo and thus lead me to programming the arduino to play a üéµ song üéπ. Luckily, there are many resources online with the code already made for creating arduino songs so it was relatively easy to manipulate what was already available to create what I wanted (another great benefit of creative computing with arduino!).

Here is a demo of what it should sound like: (pls be kind, it is still a wip ü•∫ would also love if you have any reccommendations/contributions üòâ #collaboration)

**Creative Computing and Memes are Never Gonna Let You Down!**

Now that you have been Rick Rolled, a segway into my research ;
## Disseminating the Power that Memes Hold on the Modern World

People express themselves through their body language, the words they say, the things they create and a host of other mechanisms. If you really think about it, memes have become a way to encapsulate emotions, experiences and thoughts in an open and honest way. They can be applied to many scenarios ranging from failing an exam to the isolating experiences of the coronavirus pandemic. 
>‚ÄúMemes condense the richness and nuances of certain sentiments into a single communicative unit (Brown, 2017).‚Äù

They can, in some way, be seen as markers of history, culture, and communities. One reference may be understood by some, but mean absolutely nothing to others. That recognition or rather lack thereof, could be indicative of differing age gaps for example. On the other hand, one image reference could be altered in a multitude of ways to fit the individuals needs, understanding, intention or humour. 
.‚ÄúA meme has no one specific author and there is no finished form (Chedid, 2016).

Through my research, I found that the importance of memes is being recognised at much higher levels. Most notably, thanks to UC Santa Barbara‚Äôs Creative Computing Initiative, graduate student Kevin Whitesides received funding to teach a new  Linguistics course "Memes: When Language and Culture Go Viral." Whitesides used concepts from various disciplines to show how people ‚Äì like memes ‚Äì make their mark on the world by ‚Äúremixing‚Äù or adding to already existing work. 

Launched in 2019, the Creative Computing Initiative at UCSB is designed to incorporate specialized coding and other technical skills into courses for humanities and fine arts students. Inspired by its mission, Whitesides  revised Linguistics‚Äô  memes course to teach students the fundamentals of multi-media work and the essence of human collaboration. The course was designed so that the hands-on, experiential, creative computing aspects would complement the academic readings and discussions. Other Creative Computing courses have been developed in English, Music, Art and Spanish.

Creative Computing applications such as [Meme Studio](https://www.meme-studio.io/create)(found through GitHub) and social media platforms such as [@ualmemes_](https://www.instagram.com/ualmemes_/?hl=en) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) encourage a collaborative and open space for anyone to create and share their humour, their stories, their ideas with the community, usually creating or sharing relatable content for their audience.

Memes shouldn't be seen as arbitrary or silly but rather should be acknowledged and possibly utilised for its ability to encapsulate our everyday realities into simple imagery and a line of text and providing a creative space to those who otherwise wouldn't tap into that side of their brains.
Now go and make some quality memes, who knows, it might become a sought-after NFT one day like the "Side-eye Chloe."
